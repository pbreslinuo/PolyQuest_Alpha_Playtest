PolyQuest_Alpha_Playtest
PolyQuest Alpha -- New in this version: enemies that can kill you and can be killed. Updated sprite animations.

A, D, Space to move, R to reset the level. Right control to shoot arrows. The jumping system is hard on purpose.
Nothing happens when you “win” yet, but the point is to get to the exit in the right orientation.
